    <h2>Whats Up! I'm Lucas Caswell, an aspiring Software Engineer!</h2>
    <p>I've been coding since 2022, and Ever since I can remember, I have been facinated by how things work, more specifically computers. From breaking apart and putting lego pieces back together, to figure out how they work, my mind has always been brimming with curiosity. Now, as a sophmore in Dublin High School, I am challenged with creating online orders using Python and web developing using CSS, HTML and JS.  Looking towards the future, I envision myself getting a degree in software engineering, with each experience fueling my passion and reinforces my commitment to make a meaningfull impact through engineering.
